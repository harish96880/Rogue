### Summary of Learnings from the Problem 1382 on Leetcode
#leetcode #java #recursion #binarysearchtree #balancedbinarysearchtree
#### Key Concepts Learned:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
    
    - **Structure:** In a BST, the left subtree always contains values less than its root, and the right subtree contains values greater than its root.
    - **Operations:** Efficient for searching, inserting, and lookups due to its sorted nature.
2. **Balanced Binary Search Tree:**
    
    - **Definition:** A balanced BST maintains the property where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is no more than 1 for every node.
    - **Efficiency:** Provides better performance for search, insert, and lookup operations compared to an unbalanced BST.
3. **Checking Balance:**
    
    - **Criterion:** A tree is balanced if the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is less than or equal to 1.
4. **Tree Traversals:**
    
    - **Inorder Traversal:** Visits nodes in the order: left subtree, root, right subtree. Results in a sorted list of values for a BST.
    - **Preorder Traversal:** Visits nodes in the order: root, left subtree, right subtree.
    - **Postorder Traversal:** Visits nodes in the order: left subtree, right subtree, root.
5. **Approach to Balancing a BST:**
    
    - **Inorder Traversal:** Collect the node values in a sorted list.
    - **Constructing Balanced BST:** Use the sorted list to build a balanced BST from scratch by recursively choosing the middle element as the root for each subtree.

#### Key Takeaways:

1. **Understanding BSTs:**
    
    - BST structure and properties ensure efficient operations by maintaining order through its left and right subtrees.
2. **Importance of Balance:**
    
    - A balanced BST improves performance, making operations faster compared to an unbalanced BST.
3. **Balance Check Method:**
    
    - Checking the balance involves verifying that the height difference between left and right subtrees is within 1 for all nodes.
4. **Traversals for Sorted Data:**
    
    - Inorder traversal is particularly useful for extracting sorted data from a BST.
    - Preorder and postorder traversals have their specific use cases, such as tree reconstruction and post-order tree destruction.
5. **Balanced BST Construction:**
    
    - Using inorder traversal to create a sorted list of node values.
    - Recursively constructing a balanced BST from this sorted list ensures that the tree remains balanced.
