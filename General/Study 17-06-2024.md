### Topics Covered Today:

1. Atomicity in databases.
2. Vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.
3. Comparison of SQL and NoSQL databases.
4. Considerations for choosing database types based on application requirements.
5. Hybrid database approach for e-commerce applications.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Atomicity in Databases:**
    
    - Atomicity ensures that database transactions are either completed in their entirety or not at all, helping maintain data integrity by rolling back transactions on failure.
2. **Vertical Scaling vs. Horizontal Scaling:**
    
    - **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources like CPU, RAM, or storage.
    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more servers or nodes to distribute the workload across multiple machines, essential for handling large-scale applications and improving fault tolerance.
3. **SQL and NoSQL Databases:**
    
    - **SQL Databases:** Traditional relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, known for ACID compliance and handling complex queries.
    - **NoSQL Databases:** Non-relational databases like MongoDB and Cassandra, designed for scalability, flexibility with schema-less data models, and eventual consistency.
4. **Scalability Considerations:**
    
    - Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors like data structure, consistency requirements (ACID), scalability needs, and operational complexity.
5. **Hybrid Approach for E-commerce:**
    
    - Combining SQL (MySQL) for transactional data (orders, payments) and NoSQL (MongoDB) for non-transactional data (user profiles, product information) optimizes performance, scalability, and data management based on workload characteristics.
