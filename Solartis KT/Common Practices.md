#solartis 

	We have initialized and defined the logger and performance list for each and every API.

	We must also mention the salience under the ruleflow-group in DRL files.

	We can copy and paste the beginning and end of the API's drl file code when creating new API, which helps to reduce time. These are mostly boilerplate code used to check whether the rule is already executed or if the exception is handled properly.
