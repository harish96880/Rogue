### System design:

* System design involves creating architectures that solves complex problems efficiently.
* Key components includes clients, servers, databases and communication protocols between them.

### Scaling Systems:

* Scalability ensures that system can handle increased load by adding resources or nodes.
* Techniques like load balancing and database sharding aid in scaling.

### Data Storage:

* Understanding SQL (relational) and No-SQL (document, key-value pair) databases.
* Concepts of sharding(Splitting database into smaller parts) and replication(Making copies of data for safety) for data distribution and redundancy.

### Caching:

* Caching increases the performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user.
* Redis and Memcached are popular caching solutions with different use cases.

### Networking and APIs:

* TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS protocols for communication between systems.
* Design Restful APIs with clear endpoints and http methods.

### Scalability vs Availability vs Stability:

* Scalability ensures that system handles growth
* Availability ensures that system remain operational
* Stability ensures that system's resilience and minimizing downtime

### Performance Optimization:

* Techniques include minimizing latency, optimizing database queries, and efficient resource management.
* Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana help identify bottleneck performance.

### Distributed Systems:

* Principles include CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance).
* Microservice architecture and distributed databases like mongodb , cassandra enhance scalability and fault tolerance.

### Consensus Algorithm:

* Paxos and Raft algorithm ensures consistency and fault tolerance in distributed systems.
* Understanding how these algorithms work to achieve consensus.

### Monitoring and Logging:

* Importance of monitoring system metrics(CPU, memory usage) and application logs.
* Tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Prometheus aid in real time monitoring and analysis.
