### What is routing ? 

	With routing, we match the different url's to different ui views. This enables user to navigate between different application screens, using the browser URL. Keep the UI in sync with the current browser URL. Allow us to build single page applications(SPA).

### Single-Page Applications:

	Application that is executed entirely on client
	Routes: Different url's corresponds to different views
	JavaScript (React) is used to update the DOM
	The Page is never reloaded
	Feels like a native app
	Additional data might be loaded from the API
